Timestamp/Simple version 1.00
=============================

BACKGROUND

Usually creating adhoc logfiles for various purposes, such as
debugging and reporting, I realized I kept using the same,
very simple, timestamp subroutine over and over.

I figured other people might find it useful, too.

Right now it's pure Perl, although it would probably benefit from
being a compiled C module.  In fact, if you can't install it as a
module, you may simply open the Simple.pm file, and copy the stamp
subroutine to your own code.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
